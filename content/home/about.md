## About me

I am an Assessment Researcher at [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) where my primary responsibilities focus on the research and development of the [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/). Prior to joining Duolingo, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Second Language Studies at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa and the Director of Assessment at the University of Kentucky. I earned my PhD in applied linguistics with a concentration in language assessment and quantitative research methods from Northern Arizona University. Occasionally, I write about my interests and projects here.
